This code in this guide assumes you are using a `src` directory and have the following path aliases configured.

```json tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

If your setup varies from this, please adjust the code snippets appropriately.
