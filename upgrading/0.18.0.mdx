title: Upgrading to 0.18.0
---

If you haven't upgraded to `0.15.0` please read the [upgrading guide](/upgrading/0.15.0).

### Migrate to @makeswift/runtime/controls

<Warning>
This upgrade guide is only necessary if you're using deprecated APIs from `@makeswift/runtime/prop-controllers`. If you're not using these APIs, you can safely skip this upgrade guide.
</Warning>

Update your components to use controls from `@makeswift/runtime/controls` instead of `@makeswift/runtime/prop-controllers`.

Example:

```diff
- import { List, Shape } from '@makeswift/runtime/prop-controllers';
+ import { List, Shape } from '@makeswift/runtime/controls';
```

For more information about the available controls and how to use them, please refer to the [controls documentation](/concepts#basic-controls).
