## Props

Props are the primary way to pass data into a React component. They are one of the two types of data that control a component. The other type of data is state, which is used to control data within the component.

Props are passed into the render function of a component as an object in the first argument position. The object contains all the props passed into the component.

```jsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>{props.name}</div>
}
```

You can read more about props in the [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component).

## Controls

Controls describe the way users can pass data to your components props. Each control maps a [prop](#props) on your component to user interface elements such as [panels](#panels) and [overlays](#overlays). Controls are defined when [registering components](/reference/register-component).

There are two types of controls: [basic](#basic) and [composable](#composable) controls.

### Basic controls

Basic controls cannot contain other controls. Multiple basic controls can provide the same type of data, but with different user interfaces. For example you can provide a `string` to your component with a [`TextInput`](/reference/controls/text-input), [`TextArea`](/reference/controls/text-area), [`Select`](/reference/controls/select), or [`Combobox`](/reference/controls/combobox) control. Here are all of the basic controls:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Checkbox"
    icon="square-check"
    href="/reference/controls/checkbox"
  />
  <Card title="Color" icon="palette" href="/reference/controls/color" />
  <Card
    title="Combobox"
    icon="input-pipe"
    href="/reference/controls/combobox"
  />
  <Card title="Image" icon="image" href="/reference/controls/image" />
  <Card title="Link" icon="link" href="/reference/controls/link" />
  <Card title="Number" icon="input-numeric" href="/reference/controls/number" />
  <Card title="Select" icon="list-dropdown" href="/reference/controls/select" />
  <Card
    title="TextArea"
    icon="input-text"
    href="/reference/controls/text-area"
  />
  <Card
    title="TextInput"
    icon="input-text"
    href="/reference/controls/text-input"
  />
</CardGroup>

There are 3 special basic controls that are designed for specific types of props such as `className` and `children`:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Style" icon="droplet" href="/reference/controls/style" />
  <Card title="RichText" icon="text" href="/reference/controls/rich-text" />
  <Card title="Slot" icon="square-dashed" href="/reference/controls/slot" />
</CardGroup>

- The [`Style`](/reference/controls/style) control provides multiple [overlays](#overlays) and [panels](#panels) that modify various CSS properties. This data is then passed to your component as a `string` value.

- The [`RichText`](/reference/controls/rich-text) control provides a `ReactNode` to your component, and then renders an inline rich text editor [overlay](/reference/concepts/overlays) wherever that `ReactNode` is rendered.

- The [`Slot`](/reference/controls/slot) control provides a `ReactNode` to your component, and places a drop zone [overlay](/reference/concepts/overlay) wherever the prop is rendered. Users can then add components visually to that drop zone.

### Composable controls

Composable controls provide an `array` or `object` to a prop of your component. Composable controls have a `type` property that can recursively contain any control. The [`List`](/reference/controls/list) control is used to modify props that expect an `array`, and the [`Shape`](/reference/controls/shape) control is used to modify props that expect an `object`.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="List" icon="list" href="/reference/controls/list" />
  <Card title="Shape" icon="brackets-curly" href="/reference/controls/shape" />
</CardGroup>
