## Default host

Makeswift offers free hosting, allowing you to start building without the need for setting up your own custom host. This lets you dive into the Makeswift builder and start using stock components.

You can still connect a custom domain with default hosting, but you may encounter limitations with other features.

|                   | Default Host | Custom Host |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Custom Domain     | ✅           | ✅          |
| Snippets          | ✅           | ✅          |
| Builder Access    | ✅           | ✅          |
| Custom API's      |              | ✅          |
| Localization      |              | ✅          |
| Integrations      |              | ✅          |
| Custom Components |              | ✅          |

## Custom host

Setting up a custom host gives you full flexibility with Makeswift. You can use features such as [localization](/product/localization), [custom breakpoints](/developer/reference/runtime/constructor#custom-breakpoints), and [adding custom components](/product/components).

For help setting up a custom host visit our [developer docs](/developer/app-router/installation).
