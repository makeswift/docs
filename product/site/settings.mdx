Within site settings you can:

1. Rename the site
2. Set the site's favicon
3. View the sitemap
4. Take the site offline or online
5. Delete the site

## Favicon

To use a custom favicon, click “Change favicon”. The files manager will open, allowing you to select an existing file or add a new one.

A `.png` file with minimum dimensions of 32 x 32 pixels is recommended. Keep in mind that favicons are displayed at only 16 x 16 pixels in the browser tab, so anything larger than 32 x 32 pixels is unnecessary.

## Sitemap

You can download an `.xml` file of your sitemap from your site settings. Learn more about [sitemaps](/product/site/sitemaps).

## Archive site

When you archive a site all pages will be taken offline and you will not be billed for this site in future invoices. It's important to note that your pages will still be available and will seem to be online via the green live indicator, however they are not online.

You may choose to take an archived site back online. This will publish all pages that were previously live on your site as indicated by the green live icon.

## Delete site

Deleting a site will remove all of its collections, pages, site files, and site database tables. Deleting a site cannot be undone. Form submissions saved to a workspace table will remain in your database and will not be deleted.
