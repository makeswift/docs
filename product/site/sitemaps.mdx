An XML sitemap file is automatically generated for every site built in Makeswift. You can view your sitemap from the site settings.

<Note>
  To configure the sitemap for your custom Next.js host, [read our developer
  docs](/developer/reference/client/get-sitemap)
</Note>

For each page you can customize it's sitemap priority and frequency settings. These are located in the Page tab in the right sidebar.

## Submitting your sitemap to Google

Although your sitemap is automatically generated, it's recommended that you submit it to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/not-verified?original_url=/search-console/sitemaps&original_resource_id) so it can start crawling your site sooner. Navigate to your settings, and click “View sitemap” in the Sitemap section of the site settings. Copy and paste the URL from the new tab and paste it into the Search Console when prompted, then click “Submit”.
