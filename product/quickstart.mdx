If you already have a site and want to create a new one, click the **Create new site** button under the site list dropdown. If this is your first time using Makeswift, [create a free account](https://app.makeswift.com/signup). You'll then be taken to the page for creating a new site.

You have two options to get started: **Start with the builder** or **Integrate with Next.js**.

<Info>
  Starting with the Visual Builder utilizes Makeswift's [default
  host](/product/site/hosting#default-host) while Integrating with Next.js will
  prompt you to utilize your own [custom
  host](/product/site/hosting#custom-host).
</Info>

Click **Go to the builder**, and you'll have a list of templates to choose from. Templates come with existing assets (images, logos, etc.), colors, text styles, and layouts for you to begin customizing.

Choose the **Venture** template and click **Use this site**.

## Visual Builder overview

Once your new site is created, you'll be taken to the Visual Builder which is composed of 4 main sections:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Navigation Sidebar">
    Explore your sites, pages, files, and settings.
    <Frame>
    ![ Makeswift builder Navigation Sidebar](/images/quickstart/builder-layout-navigation-sidebar.jpg)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>

<Tab title="Component Toolbar">
  Access components to add to the Canvas.
  <Frame>

</Tab>

<Tab title="Canvas">
  Build your pages and see them come to life with an exact preview.
  <Frame>
    ![ Makeswift builder canvas](/images/quickstart/builder-layout-canvas.jpg)
  </Frame>
</Tab>

  <Tab title="Properties Sidebar">
    Edit properties of a page, site, or component.
    <Frame>
      ![ Makeswift builder panels](/images/quickstart/builder-layout-properties-sidebar.jpg)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Before moving on, take a few minutes to explore the Canvas and its components. Click on any component in the Canvas to see its corresponding properties in the Properties Sidebar.
