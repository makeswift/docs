import VisualBuilderOverview from "/snippets/builder/visual-builder-overview.mdx";

If you already have a site and want to create a new one, click the **Create new site** button under the site list dropdown. If this is your first time using Makeswift, [create a free account](https://app.makeswift.com/signup). You'll then be taken to the page for creating a new site.

You have two options to get started: **Start with the builder** or **Integrate with Next.js**.

<Info>
  Starting with the Visual Builder utilizes Makeswift's [default
  host](/product/site/hosting#default-host), while Integrating with Next.js will
  prompt you to utilize your own [custom
  host](/product/site/hosting#custom-host).

Click **Go to the builder**, and you'll have a list of templates to choose from. Templates come with existing assets (images, logos, etc.), colors, text styles, and layouts for you to begin customizing.

Choose the **Venture** template and click **Use this site**.
