## Readiness Phases

Early access features undergo three readiness phases before reaching full production. Each phase represents a different level of stability and commitment, helping you understand what to expect when using these features.

### Experimental

Experimental features are in early stages of development and may be removed altogether. Use experimental features with caution and avoid relying on them for critical workflows. These features:

- Are **rapidly evolving** and may change significantly without notice
- **May be removed altogether** if they don't meet our quality standards or user needs
- Are not recommended for production use
- Are valuable for early feedback and testing new concepts

### Alpha

Alpha features are on track for production, but we're still refining them. Your feedback helps us shape these features before their final release. These features:

- **Might evolve** based on user feedback and testing
- We **intend to eventually bring to production**, but the exact form may change
- Are more stable than Experimental, but breaking changes are still possible
- Are suitable for testing in non-critical environments

### Beta

Beta features are nearly ready for production in design but may have minor bugs. We encourage you to use them and report any issues you encounter. These features:

- Have a **stable form** that we're committed to
- The current implementation is final, though **bugs may exist**
- Are safe to use in most scenarios
- Will receive bug fixes and polish before full release
