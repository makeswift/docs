Feature previews let you try upcoming features before they're fully released. When a feature is in beta, you can opt in from your user settings.

Find **Feature previews** by clicking the **Settings** tab in the Navigation Sidebar and then **Feature previews**. Toggle a feature on to enable it for your account.
