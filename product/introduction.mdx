With Makeswift, you can quickly build fully functioning websites with no-code. You have the ability to create pages, design layouts, manage colors and text styles, and publish your site for the world to see. To learn more about the Visual Builder, we recommend following the [hands-on Quickstart](/product/quickstart).

## Default vs custom host

Makeswift provides a free default host which allows you to publish your site without managing any of the hosting. This is the quickest way to get started.

For more advanced used cases, though, you can integrate Makeswift into a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that you deploy and host yourself. This is referred to as a [custom host](/product/site/hosting#custom-host). By doing this, you can create custom components, integrate data sources, and have full conrol over your hosting.

For full details on how to integrate Makeswift into a Next.js project, refer to the [Developer Quickstart](/developer/quickstart).
