<Note>
  Routes do not support [page
  collections.](/product/pages-tab#managing-collections) However, if page
  collections exist when enabling Routes they will be preserved and not deleted.

Routes represent external pages (not managed by Makeswift) that you want to include in your site's navigation structure.

The main difference between a page and a route is that you cannot change the URL or delete a route from the Pages Tab. However, You can edit the content after navigating to a route if it has been integrated with Makeswift.

Routes are useful for several scenarios:

- **External content**: Blog posts managed in a CMS or products in an e-commerce platform
- **Hardcoded pages**: Any static pages you don't want to be editable in Makeswift but want visible for better discoverability
- **Authentication pages**: Sign up and login views with editable marketing content integrated
- **System pages**: Terms of service, privacy policy, or other fixed content pages

These routes will appear in the Pages Tab alongside your Makeswift-managed pages, giving you a complete view of your site's structure.
