Routes organize your pages by [pathname](/product/page/paths), providing a sitemap-like view that makes it easier to find and navigate between pages across your entire site. Routes represent external pages (not created in Makeswift) that you want to include in your site's navigation structure.

<Note>
  Routes that are not Makeswift pages cannot be edited in the page builder.

When enabled, the Pages Tab in the Site Sidebar displays both pages and routes associated with your site. You can tell if an item is a route by the route icon that appears to the right of the name in the Pages Tab. A tooltip also appears stating "_This page is managed externally_".
