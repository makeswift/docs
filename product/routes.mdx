<Note>If the route is external you can view it **only** and are unable to edit it in the page builder</Note>

In addition to pages, you can also opt-in to view and manage [routes (beta)](#routes-beta) associated with your site.  When enabled, routes organize your pages by pathname, providing a sitemap-like view that makes it easier to find and navigate between pages across your entire site.

- In the bottom of the Site Sidebar, click **Settings**.
