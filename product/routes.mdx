  Routes are currently in Beta and can be enabled via the [Early Access](/product/user-settings/early-access) settings.
</Callout>

<Note>
  Routes do not support [collections](/product/pages-tab#managing-collections). However, if
  collections exist when enabling Routes they will be preserved and not deleted.

Routes represent external pages (not managed by Makeswift) that you want to include in your site's navigation structure.

The main difference between a page and a route is that you cannot change the URL or delete a route from the Pages Tab. However, you can edit the content after navigating to a route if it has been integrated with Makeswift.

Routes are useful for several scenarios:

- **External content**: Blog posts managed in a CMS or products in an e-commerce platform
- **Hardcoded pages**: Any static pages you don't want to be editable in Makeswift but want visible for better discoverability
- **Authentication pages**: Sign up and login views with editable marketing content integrated
- **System pages**: Terms of service, privacy policy, or other fixed content pages

To enable routes on your site, you must enable the feature in the [**Early access**](/product/user-settings/early-access) settings:

<Frame>
  ![Settings page to enable routes](/images/routes/enable-routes.png)
</Frame>

Once enabled, the Pages Tab in the Site Sidebar will display both pages and routes associated with your site. You can identify routes by the route icon that appears to the right of the name. A tooltip will also appear stating "_This page is managed externally_".

</Frame>

A new Site setting called **Routes** will also be available in the Settings dialog. This setting allows you to add, edit, and delete routes that you want to see in the Pages Tab.
