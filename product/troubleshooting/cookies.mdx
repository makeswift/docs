## What are Cookies?

[Cookies](https://web.dev/articles/understanding-cookies) are a tool used by
sites to set small pieces of data on the browser. Some features that often rely
on cookies include:

- Saving login data after a user logs in to a site
- Storing what items a user has added to their shopping cart
- Tracking user analytics and behavior

If your site relies on setting cookies, you may notice some issues with how your
site behaves when you load it in the Makeswift Visual Builder. This is because
your site is embedded inside an `<iframe>` when it loads in our builder. When an
embedded site (in this case, your site) is attempting to set a cookie, that
cookie is considered by the browser as a [**third-party
cookie**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Guides/Third-party_cookies).
Modern web browsers have privacy restrictions on how third-party cookies are
set. As a result, you may see issues related to cookies inside the builder, but
not in your live page. 

## Browser Settings

If cookie related issues are impacting your editing experience, there's some
ways you can modify your browser settings to allow third-party cookies to be
set: We'll go over how for the major browsers:

### Chrome / Brave / Arc

Chrome (and other Chromium based browsers, like [Brave](https://brave.com/) and
[Arc](https://arc.net/)) allow you to control whether specific sites can set
third-party cookies. With their plan to soon disable all third-party cookies, it
may be helpful to allow your site to set third-party cookies:

1. In the URL bar, go to `chrome://settings/cookies`
2. In the **Site allowed to use third party cookies** section, click the
   **Add** button.
3. A text input will appear that allows you to add a domain. Add your site's
   domain. For example, if your host is on `example.com`, enter
   `example.com` in the text input.
   - You can also match your other subdomains, like `custom.example.com`, by
   using a matcher: `[*.]example.com`.

For more information on modifying Chrome's cookie permissions for you site, [see this
article](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647).

<Warning>
   Even with these browser settings, Chrome will still not allow sites to
   set third-party cookies **unless the cookie has specific attributes**. For your
   site, this means that your developer will have to make some changes to how
   cookies are set. See the [Developer Settings](#developer-settings) section for
   more details.
</Warning>

### Firefox

Since 2021, Firefox automatically partitions third-party cookies, which means
that any cookies your site sets while you're using the Makeswift Visual Builder
will only be saved within the builder. Because of this, your site should behave
as expected within Makeswift, without any action needed on your part.

If you're still encountering issues, you can modify your browser settings:

1. Go to **Preferences** > **Privacy & Security**
2. Under the **Cookies and Site Data** section, click **Manage Exceptions**
3. In the dialog that appears, enter your site's domain name and click **Allow**.

For more information on modifying Firefox's cookie permissions for you site, [see this
article](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/third-party-cookies-firefox-tracking-protection).

### Safari

To disable Safari's third-party cookie restrictions:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy**
2. Uncheck the box for **Website tracking: Prevent cross-site tracking**.

Disabling this setting will allow all website to set third-party cookies, not
just your site within Makeswift. If you have privacy concerns, feel free to turn
on the protections again when you're done editing your site in Makeswift.

## Developer Settings

If none of the above settings worked, you may need your developer to modify how
cookies are set. Some browsers require that your site uses certain values when
setting a cookie so that it can be properly set in a third-party context. See
[this article](/developer/guides/how-to/setting-cookies) for more details.
