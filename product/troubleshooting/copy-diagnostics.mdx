Copy diagnostics is a helpful feature in the Makeswift Visual Builder that allows you to quickly copy important technical information about your site and current session. This information can be useful if you need to share technical details with a developer, need support from the Makeswift team, or when troubleshooting issues with your site.

## Using copy diagnostics

To use copy diagnostics:

1. Open your site in the Makeswift Visual Builder.
2. Click **Help**, then **Copy diagnostics** in the bottom left of the Navigation Sidebar. Your site's diagnostic information will be copied to your clipboard.
3. Paste the information wherever you want to share it, such as a support email or developer chat.
