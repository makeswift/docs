## Adding locales

Makeswift's localization feature allows you to manage localized versions of your web pages directly within the builder. You'll need to configure your locales in code, and then add them into the Locales settings within Makeswift to enable the locale toggle in the builder.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add locales in the Makeswift builder">
    Open site settings and go to the "Locales" tab.

    <Frame>
      ![Localization first step](/images/localization-first-step.png)
    </Frame>

    To add a new locale, click the "+ Add locale" button. You can modify or delete existing locales by hovering over the locale:

    <Frame>
      ![Hovering over the locale](/images/localization-hover-locale.png)
    </Frame>

    You can also modify the default locale by hovering over it and clicking the edit button.

    Here's an example of what a list of locales in settings looks like:

    <Frame>
      ![Manage locales in settings](/images/localization-manage-locales.png)
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure locales in your Next.js config">
    For detailed instructions on setting up locales, see our [developer docs](/developer/app-router/localization) on localization.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit your pages in the builder">

    Once you've finished setting up your locales in Makeswift and in your codebase, you should be able to switch to different locales using the locale switcher in the builder browser bar.

    <Frame>
      ![Manage locales in settings](/images/localization-locales-switcher.png)
    </Frame>

    When making changes in a different locale you can override any property, including the page's pathname, metadata, and SEO tags.

    <Info>
      You can customize the path for each page in each locale. For example, if you
      have a company page at `example.com/company`, you can create the Spanish
      version of the page at `example.com/es/compania` or `example.es/compania`.
    </Info>

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Localized global components

You can also localize a global component. To do this, edit a global component within a localized page and then save the global component.

<Note>
  You must save a global component in a locale before switching and editing it
  in another locale.
