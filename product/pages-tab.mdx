The Pages Tab in the Site Sidebar allows you to view and manage your site's pages. You can select a page to edit it in the page builder, or access additional options using the Action Menu (three dots).

A page is a single web page with a unique [pathname](/product/page/paths) in a Makeswift site. Pages can be created from [templates](#add-from-template) or from [scratch](#add-from-scratch).
