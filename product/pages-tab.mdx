The Pages Tab in the Site Sidebar allows you to view and manage your site's pages.

A page is a single web page with a unique [pathname](/product/page/paths) in a Makeswift site. Pages can be created from [templates](#add-a-page-from-a-template) or as a [blank page](#add-a-blank-page).

Pages can be organized into [collections](#managing-collections) for better management. Collections act as folders to group related pages together without affecting the URL structure of your site.
