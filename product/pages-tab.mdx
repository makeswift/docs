The Pages Tab in the Site Sidebar allows you to view and manage your site's pages.

A page is a single web page with a unique [pathname](/product/page/paths) in a Makeswift site.

Pages can be organized into [collections](#managing-collections). Collections act as folders to group related pages together without affecting the URL structure of your site.
