[Global Components](/product/components#global-components) are groups of components that can be saved and reused across your entire site. This is a perfect use case for sections that should look the same across all pages like navbars, footers, etc. In fact, the **Navbar** component in the **Venture** template is a Global Component.

## Editing the navbar

In the top part of the canvas, select the **Navbar** component. When you click on it, notice you don't immediately see its properties in the Properties Sidebar. Since this is a Global Component, you must enter edit mode to make changes.

  button](/images/quickstart/global-component-edit-button.jpg)
</Frame>

With the **Navbar** component selected, click **Edit component** in the Properties Sidebar to enter edit mode. You'll now see the properties associated with this global component. In the canvas, click on the nested component with the name **Navigation**. Here you can edit the links in the Navbar component.

</Frame>

<Note>
  [Boxes](/product/components#box) are used to build layouts. They can contain
  text, images, buttons, and other components. You can add, remove, and
  rearrange boxes to create your desired layout.
</Note>

In the Properties Sidebar, click on the **Sign up** link, and change the color to purple by clicking on the color picker. You should see the color change on the canvas. Then, click **Save**.

    title="Components and properties"
    className="w-full aspect-video"
    src="/images/quickstart/global-component-edit-navbar-button.mp4"
  ></video>
</Frame>

## View changes across pages

Because this is a global component, you'll be able to see these changes propogated on other pages that use the **Navbar** component as well. To see this, click on the **About** page in the Navigation Sidebar on the left. Once it loads, you should see the Navbar with the purple **Sign up** button.

</Frame>

For future reference, you can find all of your Global Components in the Component Toolbar. For more details, check out the [Global Components docs](/product/components#global-components).
