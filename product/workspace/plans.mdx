## Subscription plans

Makeswift includes a few different self-service tiers for you and your team to get started. If you need higher limits or features that aren't available on those plans, please contact us at [support@makeswift.com](mailto:support@makeswift.com) to discuss a custom Enterprise plan.

For full plan details and pricing, please visit the [Pricing](https://makeswift.com/pricing) page.

## Downgrading Plans

You are able to downgrade your plan at any time. However, when you downgrade, limitations of the new plan will take place immediately regardless of how much time you have left in the billing cycle. To ensure no unintended loss of features, we recommend that you downgrade your plan near the end of the billing cycle.

If you are on an Enterprise plan and wish to cancel your plan, please contact support via the chat in the Makeswift app or by emailing [support@makeswift.com](mailto:support@makeswift.com).
