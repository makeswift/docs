## Managing Users

Only workspace Owners and Admins can manage users. To add users, enter one or more emails (separated by commas) in the form at the top right of the Users view. You can also set the user's role when inviting them.

Invited users will receive an email with a link to accept the invite. They'll be redirected to Makeswift to finalize the process. If it's their first time using Makeswift, they'll need to create an account after clicking the invite link. Existing users must log in with the matching email address.

While an invite is pending, Owners or Admins can resend the invitation or cancel it. Ownership can be transferred to any user who has accepted an invite.

Users can be removed from a workspace using the role dropdown next to each user.

## Permissions & Roles

There are four user roles, each with different permissions:

### Owners and Admins

Owners and Admins share almost identical permissions. The only difference is that Owners cannot be removed from a workspace. They have full access to a workspace and can:

- Manage users
- View and manage billing
- Connect a custom host
- Edit a site's theme
- Build and edit page content and layout
- Publish a site
- Edit database tables

<Note>Owners can transfer ownership to another user</Note>

### Publishers

Publishers have access to anything related to site content. They can:

- Connect a custom host
- Edit a site's theme
- Build and edit page content and layout
- Publish a site
- Edit database tables

### Editors

Editors can build and edit page content and layout but cannot publish changes that affect live pages. They cannot update a site's theme or make changes to a database table.

## Profile

In the Profile tab within settings you can edit your own personal profile information such as name and avatar. You can also change your email address and reset your password.
