## Overall layout

import VisualBuilderOverview from "/snippets/builder/visual-builder-overview.mdx";

The Visual Builder is composed of 4 sections:

<VisualBuilderOverview />

## Build & Interact modes

In the Component Toolbar, you'll notice two modes that dictate how you can engage with the elements on your Canvas, **Build** and **Interact**.

  ></video>
</Frame>

### Build mode

Build mode is the default mode and is most likely where you'll spend the majority of your time in the Visual Builder. It allows you to customize your website visually by dragging and dropping components, rearranging them to build layouts, and editing their properties.

### Interact mode

Interact mode renders your site in a way that allows you to engage with any interactive element (e.g. buttons, links, etc.) without having to formally [Publish](/product/publishing) or [Preview](/product/publishing#previewing) your site. This is particularly useful to expose and edit a piece of content that requires a button click to be shown. A good example of this would be content within an accordion.

## Elements Panel

The Elements Panel allows users to easily view and select individual components from your page. Nested components will be displayed in a hierarchical structure, making it easy to understand the page structure and relationship between components.

## Multiplayer

Makeswift's multiplayer facilitates real-time collaboration for you and your team. You can see who is editing a page in real time right in the canvas.

## Copy & Paste

When creating a site in the Visual Builder, it's common to want to reuse content and layouts that you've previously created. You can use the Visual Builder's copy and paste feature to duplicate elements quickly.

To copy and paste a selected element, use the actions menu at the top right of the [Properties Sidebar](/product/builder-basics), or by use keyboard shortcuts.

<Frame>
  ![Menu actions for component](/images/builder/components-menu-actions.jpeg)
</Frame>

- Copy a component `⌘ + C` - copies the selected element to your clipboard
- Paste a component `⌘ + V` - places the copied element in the [Canvas](/product/builder-basics) (you choose exactly where to place it)

If you're copying and pasting across sites, any contained resources (like images, colors, global elements) will need to be remapped to the new site.
See our [Copy & Paste Across Sites](/product/visual-builder/copy-paste-across-sites) guide for more information.
