The Visual Builder is composed of 4 sections:

<VisualBuilderOverview />

## Build & Interact modes

In the Component Toolbar, you'll notice two options that dictate how you can engage with the elements on your Canvas, **Build** mode and **Interact** mode.

    className="w-full aspect-video"
    src="/images/builder/builder-basics/build-vs-interact-icons.mp4"
  ></video>
</Frame>

### Build mode

Build mode is the default mode and is most likely where you'll spend the majority of your time in the Visual Builder. It allows you to customize your website visually by dragging and dropping components, rearranging them to build layouts, and editing their properties.

<Frame>
  <video
    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    playsInline
    title="Using build mode"
    className="w-full aspect-video"
    src="/images/builder/builder-basics/build-mode.mp4"
  ></video>
</Frame>

### Interact mode

Interact mode renders your site in a way that allows you to engage with any interactive element (e.g. buttons, links, etc.) to see its behavior within the Visual Builder without having to formally [Publish](/product/publishing) or [Preview](/product/publishing#previewing) your site.

In this example, Interact mode allows you to see the hover effects for navigation links.

<Frame>
  <video
    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    playsInline
    title="Using interact mode"
    className="w-full aspect-video"
    src="/images/builder/builder-basics/hover-effect-interact.mp4"
  ></video>
</Frame>

You might also need to use Interact mode to expose a piece of content that requires a button click to be shown. A good example of this would be content within an accordion.

## Elements Panel

The Elements Panel allows users to easily view and select individual components from your page. Nested components will be displayed in a hierarchical structure, making it easy to understand the page structure and relationship between components.

## Multiplayer

Makeswift's multiplayer facilitates real-time collaboration for you and your team. You can see who is editing a page in real time right in the canvas.
