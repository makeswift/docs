## Built-in components

There are four components that come standard with the Makeswift default host:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Box">
    The Box is your most valuable and versatile tool in the Component Toolbar. It works exactly as described, like a box you can place things in, but you can use it for so much more. If you're familiar with HTML, the easiest way to conceptualize a box is like a `<div>`. From a developer perspective, boxes can also be synonmous with [Slots](/developer/reference/controls/slot). Use Boxes to configure different [layouts](/product/layouts).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Text">

Double-click on any text component on your page to start editing it directly, similar to Google Docs. Text components use the "paragraph" block tag by default, but you can change it to a heading or list in the panels sidebar. Text components can also be styled with [text styles](/product/site/text-styles).

The block panel applies to an entire paragraph and correlates to the HTML tag used on the live page. Block options include:

- Paragraph
- Heading 1
- Heading 2
- Heading 3
- Heading 4
- Heading 5
- Heading 6
- Bulleted list
- Numbered list
- Blockquotes

Block tags affect a page's [SEO](/product/SEO), so make sure to use the appropriate options throughout your site.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Image">

The image component is placed directly as content on your page, unlike a background image that goes behind content. Think of an image as framed art on a wall, whereas the background image is the wallpaper behind it.

To place an image, select an image component on your page and click "Choose" or “Replace” in the panels sidebar. Select an existing image from the files manager, or upload a new one.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/builder/image-props1.gif"
    width="300"
    alt="Image panels in Makeswift"
  />
</Frame>

**Alt text** is used to provide descriptions of an image and increases the accessibility of your website for visually impaired visitors. Images can also be given links, similar to buttons.

Images will automatically be optimized and resized when published, increasing the performance of your site.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Button">
  Use buttons to create links within your pages. The following are the link options for buttons:

- Open a Makeswift page
- Open an external URL
- Compose an email
- Call a phone number
- Scroll to a component

#### Open page

When linking to other pages within your site, you'll select from a list of existing pages. Once a page is selected, the page's URL will be used for the button link. If the page's URL is updated in the future, the button link will automatically update as well.

#### Scroll to element

To use “Scroll to element” you must first give the target component a custom name. This name will now appear in the dropdown found in the button's “On click” panel.

You can also select the screen position of the scrolled to component.

#### Styling buttons

You can select from a list of premade styles for your buttons. Along with styles, you can customize the size, shape, color and text styles.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Naming components

You can name a component by selecting it and changing the default name at the top of the [Properties Sidebar](/product/builder-basics). Component names must be alphanumeric and cannot contain any spaces.

<Frame>
  ![Custom component name input](/images/builder/components-custom-name.jpeg)
</Frame>

Component names are displayed in [Breadcrumbs](/product/layouts#selecting-components) and the [Layers Panel](/product/builder-basics#layers-panel) making it easier to discern between different component.

<Frame>
  ![Copmonent label showed in
  breadcrumbs](/images/builder/components-breadcrumb-label.jpeg)
</Frame>

Custom component names also serve as the `id` property added to the component's HTML. This allows them to be scrolled to with buttons, images, and text links. All components with custom names will appear in the **Scroll to element** dropdown found in the **on click** panel.

<Frame>

  panel](/images/builder/components-scroll-to-custom-name.jpeg)
</Frame>

## Component actions

Actions for selected components can be found at the top right of the [Properties Sidebar](/product/builder-basics) or by using keyboard shortcuts.

<Frame>
  ![Menu actions for component](/images/builder/components-menu-actions.jpeg)
</Frame>

- Duplicate a component `⌘ + D` - creates an exact copy, including nested components, either below or next to the original
- Copy a component `⌘ + C` - copies the selected component to your clipboard
- Paste a component `⌘ + V` - places the copied component in the [Canvas](/product/builder-basics) (you choose exactly where to place it)
- Delete a component `DELETE` - deletes the selected component

## Global Components

Global Components are groups of components that can be saved and reused across your entire site. If you make an update to a Global Component, every instance of that component on your site will be updated as well.

### Creating a Global Component

To create a Global Component, select the Box containing the components you want to turn into a Global Component. Then, click on the cube icon found at the top of the [Properties Sidebar](/product/builder-basics).

<Frame>
  ![Create global
  component](/images/builder/components-creat-global-component.jpeg)
</Frame>

Name your global component and click **Yes, continue**.

You can find your newly created Global Components in the Component Toolbar by clicking the plus icon. Then, you can click and drag to place it on the page.

<Frame>
  ![List of components](/images/builder/components-find-global-component.jpeg)
</Frame>

### Editing a Global Component

Editing a Global Component will update all instances across your site. To edit a Global Component select any instance of that component in the [Canvas](/product/builder-basics) and click **Edit component** in the [Properties Sidebar](/product/builder-basics).

<Frame>
  ![Edit global component](/images/builder/components-detach-global.jpeg)
</Frame>

While editing a Global Component, you have full control over the content and styles for all components found in that component. You can add or remove components, and even place other Global Components inside.

When you are done with edits, click the **Save** button at the top right of the Global Component overlay.

<Frame>

  component](/images/builder/components-save-global-edit.jpeg)
</Frame>

<Note>
  Global component updates are published as separate resources from pages. Learn
  more about [publishing Global
  Components](/product/publishing#publishing-site-resources).
</Note>

### Detaching from a Global Component

Changes to a Global Component are propogated to all instances across your site. If you'd like to use a Global Component as a starting point and don't want to keep it in sync with the original component, you can detach an individual instance.

To detach, select the instance of the Global Component in the [Canvas](/product/builder-basics). Then, in the [Properties Sidebar](/product/builder-basics), click **Detach**. Remember, once detached, the instance will no longer be updated when the original Global Component is edited.

<Frame>
  ![Detach global component](/images/builder/components-detach-global.jpeg)
</Frame>

### Organizing Global Components

As your list of components grow, you may want to organize them. You can do this by including a `/` in the Global Component name. For example, a component with a name of `ui/hero` will be nested under `ui`.
