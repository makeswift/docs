## Workspace

A workspace is the digital space you and your organization share to manage sites built within Makeswift. Users are managed at the workspace level and have access to all sites in that workspace. Billing and subscription management are also handled in your workspace settings.

A user can be added to multiple workspaces. To switch to another workspace, open the site dropdown at the top left of the app, click on your current workspace to open the switcher and select another workspace to navigate to.

## Site

A Makeswift site is an instance of your website that is 1 to 1 with your domain. You can host multiple sites in the same workspace.

The following resources are shared by all pages in a site:

- [Colors](/product/site/colors)
- [Text styles](/product/site/text-styles)
- Fonts
- [Snippets](/product/site/snippets)
- Site [files](/product/files)

## Page

A page is a single web page with a unique [pathname](/product/page/paths) in a Makeswift site. Pages can be created from templates or from scratch. To create a new page in Makeswift click the “+” button in the upper left of the builder.

## Collection

Collections allow you to group pages such as blog posts and landing pages into folders. You can create unlimited collections and nest them within each other.

Organize pages and collections by dragging and dropping them. Collections and pages appear in alphabetical order in the left sidebar.

To move a page out of a collection, drag it back up to the Pages label at the top of the sidebar.
