Makeswift ensures that elements are responsive and can adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. The width of elements defaults to 100% of the maximum pixel width of your device.

## Pro tips

When creating a new section on a page, we suggest dropping in a box and setting it's width to 100%. This will allow you to add a background and have it fill up the entire section. You can then add a content box within that section and set the width to a maximum pixel width, such as 1280px, to keep your content from stretching too wide on larger screens.

<Note>
  Avoid using [padding](/product/component/property-controls/padding) instead of
  width for boxes. Width allows your element to resize responsively while
  maintaining a limit to prevent it from becoming too wide on larger screens.
  Padding is a hard pixel value that does not automatically get reduced and will
  cause your content to be squished on smaller devices.

## Shortcuts

You can manually set the value of either pixel and percentage width in the panel sidebar, however to quickly adjust an element to 100% width, you can simply drag it to full width.

## Developer notes

You can give your team control over the width property for any custom component using the [Style](/developer/reference/controls/style) control.
