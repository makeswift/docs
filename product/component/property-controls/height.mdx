By default, the height of a Box is set to be driven by its content using `auto`. Alternatively, you can select `Stretch` which will automatically stretch the height of a box to match the tallest element found in the same row.

## Pro tips

We suggest selecting `stretch` for elements like cards or grids where you want to ensure a consistent height across all elements. This will help to create a cleaner and more organized layout.
