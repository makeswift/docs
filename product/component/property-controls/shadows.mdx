Here are the following options for shadows:

- Type: drop or inner shadow
- Color
- Direction
- Distance: how far the shadow is from its element
- Blur: the softness of the shadow
- Spread: when blur is set to “0”, a larger size will act like a solid border

<Frame>
  <img width="300" src="public/images/property-panels/shadow-1.png" />
</Frame>

An element can have multiple shadows which can be layered and sorted,
allowing you to add more realistic shadows or create unique effects.

## Examples

You can change the color and angle of your shadow to add a glowing effect to a specific element.

@Andrew Reifman I think I need some examples from you here as I've never really used Shadows in a meaningful way. I'd like to capture any uses that used to take a long time to do with CSS or HTML or whatever.

## Pro tips

Avoid importing assets with shadows included in the original file, as this can be added in Makeswift.

Another tip is to lower the color opacity and use a higher blur to create softer, more realistic shadows.

## Developer notes

Since Shadows can be added to almost anything, it may not make sense to add shadows to your component if it isn't controllable within Makeswift. Unless you have multiple shadows within your component, it will likely be better handled in Makeswift.
