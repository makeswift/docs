Rounded corners can be applied to all corners uniformly or individually to specific corners. This can be used to create a variety of shapes and effects, such as rounded cards or sections.

## Pro tips

In Makeswift, you're able to select which corners you want to change the radius for within a box, allowing you to create some interesting effects and shapes. Be sure to keep in mind the contents of your box or element as corner radius does not take content into account.

The more rounded a corner the friendlier the design. Maybe show examples of two different cards with varying corner radiuses

## Shortcuts

While dragging the panel inputs for individual corners, hold the `⌥ Option` or `Alt` key to equally change parellel corners of an element. Hold `⇧ Shift  + ⌥ Option` or `Alt` to equally change all corners.
