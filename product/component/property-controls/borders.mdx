You can customize a border's **thickness**, **color**, and **style** to enhance the overall design and highlight specific content. Border can be applied to all edges uniformly or to specific sides of an element.

## Thickness

Thickness refers to the width of the border around an element. Specifying border thickness helps create elements with varying visual emphasis, from subtle accents to bold outlines.

## Color

You can select from your [site colors](/product/theming#colors) to use as a border color. Customizing border color adds visual interest, creates contrast, and reinforces branding.

## Style

Choose from styles like dotted, dashed, or solid lines to suit different design preferences. Dotted lines create a pattern of small dots; dashed lines consist of short dashes separated by spaces; and solid lines provide a continuous, unbroken border.

## Examples

Apply borders to boxes to make them pop out as cards.

You can apply borders to specific sides to create dividers between elements.

## Pro tips

Borders complement shadows, giving your boxes a crisper edge and emphasizing the depth of the shadow. Lower the border color opacity to create a more subtle effect.

## Shortcuts

While dragging the border panel inputs, hold the `⌥ Option` or `Alt` key to equally change border width on both sides of an element. Hold `⇧ Shift  + ⌥ Option` or `Alt` to equally change border width for all sides.
