## Meta tags

The following meta tags are managed within the Page tab of each page in Makeswift:

- Title
- Description
- Social image

Makeswift also uses these meta tags as the Open Graph (OG) and X (Twitter) equivalents. For example, the Title meta tag is used as the OG Title and Twitter Title.

<Note>
  For additional meta Tags that aren't standard within the page properties in
  Makeswift, or if your OG Tags differ, you must configure this in your codebase
  using a custom host. For more info view the [Next.js
  documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/seo/crawling-and-indexing/metatags).

## Canonical URL

Canonical URLs are also managed in the Page tab. Typically, these are self-referencing and thus are set by default in Makeswift.

## Sitemap settings

Your [sitemap](/product/site/sitemaps) is automatically generated for all sites using the default host. You can control several settings for your sitemap in Makeswift, including the priority and frequency of each page. These settings are located in the Page tab under your meta tags.

<Note>
  To configure the sitemap for your custom Next.js host, [read our developer
  docs](/developer/reference/client/get-sitemap)
</Note>

### Sitemap priority

Sitemap priority indicates the relative importance of pages within a website, helping search engines decide how frequently to crawl them. It ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with higher values suggesting more important pages. Makeswift pages use a default value of 0.75.

### Sitemap frequency

Sitemap frequency specifies how often a page's content is likely to change, guiding search engines on how frequently to check for updates. The default value in Makeswift is "Hourly".

## Robots

Robots metadata provides search engines with specific instructions on how to index and display that page. Makeswift allows you to control whether your pages are indexed using the “Exclude from search Engines” checkbox in the Page tab.

<Frame>

</Frame>

When unchecked, this will set the robots metadata to be `index, follow`. When checked, this will set it to be `noindex, follow`.

## Developer notes

Additional SEO panels can be added to the `<Page>` component within a custom host. View the [developer docs](/developer/reference/components/page) for more information.
