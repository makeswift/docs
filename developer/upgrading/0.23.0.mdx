title: Upgrading to 0.23.0
---

If you haven't upgraded to `0.20.0` please read the [upgrading guide](/developer/upgrading/0.20.0).

`v0.23.0` of the runtime introduces new runtime internals, 2 new components, and a few breaking changes.

## Breaking Changes

### `MakeswiftApiHandler` requires instance of `ReactRuntime`

To initialize an instance of the `MakeswiftApiHandler`, you must now pass an instance of the [ReactRuntime](/developer/reference/runtime/constructor). See [MakeswiftApiHandler](/developer/reference/makeswift-api-handler) for full details.

### API changes to support multi-document pages

The [ReactRuntimeProvider](/developer/reference/components/react-runtime-provider) component now accepts two new props: `previewMode` and `locale`. `previewMode` is required in all cases, while `locale` is required if your site supports more than one locale. Check out our updated [App Router](/developer/app-router/installation) and [Pages Router](/developer/pages-router/installation) installation guides to learn how to provide these props in both setups.

## Editable page regions

This release introduces support for editable page regions through the new page regions API, which includes two built-in React components, [`<Slot>`](/developer/reference/components/slot) and [`<MakeswiftComponent>`](/developer/reference/components/makeswift-component), along with a corresponding Makeswift client method, [`getComponentSnapshot`](/developer/reference/client/get-component-snapshot).

Check out our new [editable-regions-example](https://github.com/makeswift/makeswift/tree/main/examples/editable-regions) to learn how to combine these APIs to create a set of dynamic pages with a visually editable header, footer, and a slot for the main content.
