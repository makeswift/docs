title: Upgrading to 0.26.0
---

If you haven't yet upgraded to `0.25.0`, please review the [0.25.0 upgrade
guide](/developer/upgrading/0.25.0) first.

`v0.26.0` of the runtime optimizes the client bundle for Makeswift-integrated
hosts, and reorganizes several package exports. As part of this reorganization,
several internal functions and types have been moved to internal-only entry
points.

Refer to the [official release
notes](https://github.com/makeswift/makeswift/releases/tag/%40makeswift/runtime%400.26.0)
for the full list of changes.

## Breaking Changes

### `previewMode` option in Next.js plugin replaced

The Next.js plugin's `previewMode` option has been replaced with
`disableBuiltInPreview`. This option is `false` by default. When set to `true`,
this option disables the built-in preview mode handling provided by the plugin.
In that case, you will need to implement your own preview mode handling in order
to edit your site in the builder.

For most use cases, we recommend using the built-in preview mode handling.

### Relocated `MakeswiftComponentType` and builtin components

The `MakeswiftComponentType` export - commonly used to override Makeswift's
built-in component registrations â€” has been moved to the
`@makeswift/runtime/react/builtins` entry point:

```diff
- import { MakeswiftComponentType } from '@makeswift/runtime';
+ import { MakeswiftComponentType } from '@makeswift/runtime/react/builtins';
```

Similarly, each builtin component has been moved to its own entry point within
the `@makeswift/runtime/react/builtins` module. This structure enables better
tree-shaking and smaller client bundles.

For example, the `Image` component can now be imported from
`@makeswift/runtime/react/builtins/image`:

```diff
- import { Image } from '@makeswift/runtime/components';
+ import { Image } from '@makeswift/runtime/react/builtins/image';
```
