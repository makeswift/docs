## Builder isn't loading in Safari

If you're using Safari and the builder isn't loading, it's likely that you're running into issues
with [mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/Security/Mixed_content).

Safari blocks the loading of all mixed-content resources. This means that `https://app.makeswift.com`,
which is loaded via **HTTPS**, can't load `http://localhost:3000`, since it is loaded via **HTTP**.

The solution to this issue is to run your local Next.js app with HTTPS. If you're not familiar with this, see our <a href="https://www.makeswift.com/blog/accessing-your-local-nextjs-dev-server-using-https">how to run your Next.js app locally with HTTPS</a> blog post.

If you follow the instructions in the blog post, i.e., use `mkcert`, you might need to make sure
that Node.js trusts `mkcert`'s CA. This can be done with the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` env variable.

For example, in your `package.json`:

```diff
-    "dev": "next dev",
+    "dev": "NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=\"$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem\" next dev",
```

If you don't make this change you might see an `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE` error. Read more in
[this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68135600).

Makeswift checks if your app is running in development and will automatically bypass the SSL proxy,
so you should not encounter this error unless you're running a production build of your Next.js app
or Makeswift fails to bypass the SSL proxy for some reason.

## Builder isn't loading in Brave Browser

If you're using Brave and the builder isn't loading, it's likely you're running into issues with
Brave Shields and its restrictions on `localhost`.

Since the [#463 release](https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/pull/463), Brave blocks requests to
`localhost` from non-`localhost` documents.

To solve this issue, go to `brave://adblock` and add the following custom filter:

```
@@||localhost^$domain=app.makeswift.com
```

This prevents Brave Shields from blocking `localhost` requests from `app.makeswift.com`.
