## Prerequisites

You'll need a Makeswift site. If you don't already have one, you can follow the [developer quickstart](/developer/quickstart) or [installation guide](/developer/app-router/installation) to get started.

You'll also need to use [Makeswift runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@makeswift/runtime?activeTab=readme) **version `0.23.2` or higher.**

## Deploying

Vercel has already documented how to deploy a Next.js application with Docker. The only change you have to make when deploying your Makeswift site is to your environment variables ([details below](#environment-variables)).

Otherwise, you can follow the [Next.js with Docker](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker) documentation.

### Environment variables

You'll need to include two environment variables in your Docker build: `MAKESWIFT_SITE_API_KEY` and `MAKESWIFT_DRAFT_MODE_PROXY_FORCE_HTTP`. These will need to be added in the `.env` file that is included in your Docker build or in the dashboard of your hosting provider.

```bash
MAKESWIFT_SITE_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
MAKESWIFT_DRAFT_MODE_PROXY_FORCE_HTTP=true
```

<Note>
  <p>
    The `MAKESWIFT_DRAFT_MODE_PROXY_FORCE_HTTP` flag ensures that requests from
    Makeswift's Draft Mode proxy always use HTTP, regardless of whether the
    original request used HTTP or HTTPS. This prevents SSL errors when
    forwarding HTTPS requests to servers that only support HTTP, which is common
    for servers running in Docker containers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Setting this variable **does not** affect your external domain, which should
    always use HTTPS.
  </p>
</Note>

Your Makeswift API key can be found in the Makeswift Visual Builder under **Settings > Host**.
