  The feature is deeply integrated with [Next.js' internationalization
  features](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).

## Getting started

<Steps>

<Step title="Add locales in the Makeswift builder">
Open site settings and go to the "Locales" tab:

<Note>
  The number of locales you have access to is dependent upon your
  [plan](/product/workspace/plans). Refer to the [pricing
  page](https://makeswift.com/pricing) for full details.
</Note>

</Frame>

To add a new locale, click the "+ Add locale" button. You can modify or delete existing locales by hovering over the locale:

</Frame>

You can also modify the default locale by hovering over the default locale and clicking the edit button.

Once you add all the locales you need, it might look like this:

</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure your Next.js app for localization">

Follow the [internationalization docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization) for app router and make sure that all routes except the [Makeswift API handler](/developer/reference/makeswift-api-handler) are nested inside `/app/[lang]`.

</Step>

<Step title="Fetch snapshot by locale">

Update your catch-all route to fetch the snapshot by locale.

</Step>

<Step title="Edit your pages in the builder">

Once you've set everything up, you should be able to switch to the locale using the locale switcher on the builder.

</Frame>

<Note>

You can customize the path for each page in each locale. For example, if you have a company page at `example.com/company`, you can create the Spanish version of the page at `example.com/es/compania` or `example.es/compania`.

</Note>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Domain-based localization

If you don't provide a domain for a locale, the localized pages will be located on the same domain as the default locale,
but nested on the locale's path. For example, `es` pages will be located on `example.com/es/page`.

To use domain-based localization, just add the domain to the locale on your site settings:

<Frame>
  ![Adding domain-based on
  settings](/images/localization-domain-based-settings.png)
</Frame>

Once you've done that, the Spanish localized pages will be located on `example.es/page`.

## Localized resources

When making changes on a different locale you can override any property, including the page's pathname, metadata, and SEO tags.

You can also localize a global component. To do this, edit a global component within a localized page, make changes,
and then save the global component. That global component will be saved for that locale.
