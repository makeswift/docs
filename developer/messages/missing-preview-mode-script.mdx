title: Add the Preview Mode script to edit this page in Makeswift
---

## What this message means

This message means that the Preview Mode script rendered by `<PreviewModeScript>` isn't present in the page.

## Possible ways to fix this

Make sure you have added the `PreviewModeScript` component to the head of the page. For details,
see the `Set up a custom Document` step in the [Pages router installation guide](/developer/pages-router/installation).
