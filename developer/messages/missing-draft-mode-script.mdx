title: Add the Draft Mode script to edit this page in Makeswift
---

## What this message means

This message means that the Draft Mode script rendered by `<DraftModeScript>` isn't present in the page.

## Possible ways to fix this

Make sure you have added the `DraftModeScript` component to the head of the page. For details,
see the `Update the root layout` step in the [App Router installation guide](/developer/app-router/installation).
