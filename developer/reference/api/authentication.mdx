To use the Makeswift Public API, you'll need to create an app and obtain an API key. This guide walks you through the setup process.

## Prerequisites

Apps is currently an early access feature. You'll need to enable it before you can create an app.

## Enable Apps early access

1. Open **Settings** in the Makeswift builder
2. Navigate to **User** → **Early access**
3. Toggle on **Apps**

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/apps/toggle-apps-early-access.png"
    alt="Early access settings showing the Apps toggle"
  />
</Frame>

## Create an app

Once Apps is enabled, you can create your first app:

1. Open **Settings** in the Makeswift builder
2. Navigate to **Workspace** → **Apps**
3. Click **Create app**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/apps/go-to-apps-settings.png" alt="Apps settings page" />
</Frame>

4. Enter a **Name** for your app
5. Optionally, choose an **Icon** and add a **Description**
6. Click **Continue**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/apps/create-app.png" alt="Create app dialog" />
</Frame>

## Copy your API key

After creating your app, you'll be shown your API key. This is the only time the key will be displayed.

<Warning>
  Save your API key immediately. It won't be shown again after you close the
  dialog. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new app.
</Warning>

</Frame>

1. Click the **Copy** button or **Copy and Close** to copy the API key
2. Store the key securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets manager)

## Get your Site ID

Many API endpoints require a Site ID. To find it:

1. Open **Settings** in the Makeswift builder
2. Navigate to **Site** → **Site**
3. Copy the **Site Id** value

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/apps/copy-site-id.png"
    alt="Site settings showing Site Id"
  />
</Frame>

## Get your Workspace ID

Some API endpoints operate at the workspace level and require a Workspace ID:

1. Open **Settings** in the Makeswift builder
2. Navigate to **Workspace** → **Workspace**
3. Copy the **Workspace Id** value

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/apps/copy-workspace-id.png"
    alt="Workspace settings showing Workspace Id"
  />
</Frame>

## Using your API key

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header with every request:

```bash
curl https://api.makeswift.com/v2/sites \
  -H "x-api-key: your-api-key"
```

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code. Use
  environment variables to store your key in your application.
</Note>

## Next steps

Now that you have your API key, you can start making requests to the API:

- [List your sites](/developer/reference/api/sites/list-sites)
- [List your pages](/developer/reference/api/pages/list-pages)
- [Configure locales](/developer/reference/api/locales/create-locale)
