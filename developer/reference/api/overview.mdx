<ReadinessBadge type='beta' />

The Makeswift Public API allows you to programmatically manage your Makeswift resources. Use it to automate workflows, integrate with external systems, or build custom tooling.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.makeswift.com
```

## Authentication

Authenticate requests by including your API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl https://api.makeswift.com/v2/sites \
  -H "x-api-key: your-api-key"
```

<Note>
  Your API key can be found in your site settings. Keep it secure and never expose it in client-side code.
</Note>

## Resources

| Resource | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Sites](/developer/reference/api/sites/list-sites) | Create, read, update, delete, and duplicate sites |
| [Pages](/developer/reference/api/pages/list-pages) | Manage pages within a site |
| [Locales](/developer/reference/api/locales/list-locales) | Configure localization settings |
| [Routes](/developer/reference/api/routes/list-routes) | Define external routes for your site |

## Response format

All responses return JSON. Successful responses include an `object` field indicating the resource type:

```json
{
  "object": "site",
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "name": "My Site"
}
```

List endpoints return paginated results with a `hasMore` field:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [...],
  "hasMore": false
}
```

## Errors

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Created |
| `400` | Bad request - check your parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - invalid or missing API key |
| `404` | Not found |
| `409` | Conflict - resource already exists |
