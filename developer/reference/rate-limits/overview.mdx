The Makeswift REST API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and protect service stability. Rate limits are applied per authentication token across all endpoints.

---

## Rate Limit Configuration

### Limits

- **Rate**: 100 requests per second
- **Time Window (TTL)**: 1 second
- **Scope**: Per authentication token (API key or Bearer token)

### What This Means

Each unique API key or Bearer token is allowed to make up to 100 requests per second. The limit resets every second, providing a rolling window of allowed requests.

---

## Response Headers

<Note>
  While both API Key and Bearer Token authentication methods are supported, you
  must use **only one** authentication method per request. Requests that include
  both an API Key and Bearer Token will be rejected.
</Note>

### Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes headers showing your current rate limit status:

```http
x-ratelimit-limit: 100
x-ratelimit-remaining: 95
x-ratelimit-reset: 1
```

#### Header Descriptions

| Header                  | Description                                        | Example |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `x-ratelimit-limit`     | Maximum requests allowed in the current window     | `100`   |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining` | Number of requests remaining in the current window | `95`    |
| `x-ratelimit-reset`     | Time in seconds until the limit resets             | `1`     |

## Rate Limit Exceeded

### 429 Response

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

**Example Response:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
x-ratelimit-limit: 100
x-ratelimit-remaining: 0
x-ratelimit-reset: 1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "statusCode": 429,
  "message": "ThrottlerException: Too Many Requests",
  "error": "Too Many Requests"
}
```

### What to Do

1. **Wait**: Wait for the time specified in `x-ratelimit-reset` header (typically 1 second)
2. **Retry**: Implement exponential backoff for retries
3. **Monitor**: Track the `x-ratelimit-remaining` header to avoid hitting limits
