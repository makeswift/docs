title: "<MakeswiftComponent>"
description: The `<MakeswiftComponent>` component takes a `MakeswiftComponentSnapshot` (returned from calling [getComponentSnapshot](/developer/reference/client/get-component-snapshot)) and renders React elements using [components registered](/developer/reference/runtime/register-component) with the runtime.
---

## Props

1. <ParamField query="snapshot" type="MakeswiftComponentSnapshot" required>
     The Makeswift snapshot to render.
   </ParamField>
2. <ParamField query="label" type="string" required>
     The label of the component used in the Visual Builder.
   </ParamField>
3. <ParamField query="type" type="string" required>
     The type of the registered Makeswift component. This should match the
     `type` property that was used when calling
     [registerComponent](/developer/reference/runtime/register-component).
   </ParamField>

## Example

The following example registers a Makeswift component that allows the user to add content to a container using the Visual Builder.

First, you'll need a React component. Here, we're going to use one that has a single `children` prop, but you can customize the component and its props as needed.

```tsx @/components/container/my-container.tsx
import { ReactNode } from "react";

type Props = {
  children: ReactNode;
};

export default function MyContainer({ children }: Props) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}
```

Next, this component needs to be registered with Makeswift. This example uses the [`Slot`](/developer/reference/controls/slot) control for a `children` property. Notice this `children` property matches the name of the property defined in the `MyContainer` component.

```tsx @/components/container/my-container.makeswift.ts
import { runtime } from "@/makeswift/runtime";
import { Slot } from "@makeswift/runtime/controls";
import MyContainer from "./my-container";

//Unique identifier for the registered component that will be passed to `<MakeswiftComponent>`
export const MY_CONTAINER_TYPE = "my-container-component";

runtime.registerComponent(MyContainer, {
  type: MY_CONTAINER_TYPE,
  label: "My Container Component",
  props: {
    children: Slot(),
  },
});
```

<Note>
  Each time you register a component, you'll need to import it into both your
  `layout.tsx` file and your `makeswift/provider.tsx` file.
</Note>

Then, you'll need to retrieve the snapshot of the component from the Makeswift API by calling [`getComponentSnapshot`](/developer/reference/client/get-component-snapshot.mdx) with a unique ID and pass that snapshot to the `<MakeswiftComponent>` component.

Here, the `<MakeswiftComponent>` is being rendered on a page with the route `/my-page`.

```tsx @/app/my-page/page.tsx
import { MakeswiftComponent } from "@makeswift/runtime/next";
import { getSiteVersion } from "@makeswift/runtime/next/server";
import { MY_CONTAINER_TYPE } from "@/components/container/my-container.makeswift";
import { client } from "@/makeswift/client";

export default async function Page() {
  const myContainerSnapshot = await client.getComponentSnapshot(
    `my-container-id`, //unique identifier of the component rendered on the page
    { siteVersion: await getSiteVersion() }
  );

  return (
    <MakeswiftComponent
      snapshot={myContainerSnapshot}
      label={`My Container`}
      type={MY_CONTAINER_TYPE} //this should match the type property of the registered component
    />
  );
}
```

To see this in the Visual Builder, you'll need to navigate to `/my-page` within the URL bar. This page won't be autopopulated in the builder, so you'll need to manually navigate to it.
