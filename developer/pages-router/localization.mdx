## Getting started

<Steps>

<Step title="Add locales in the Makeswift builder">
Open site settings and go to the "Locales" tab:

![Localization first step](/images/localization-first-step.png)

To add a new locale, click the "+ Add locale" button. You can modify or delete existing locales by hovering over the locale:

![Hovering over the locale](/images/localization-hover-locale.png)

You can also modify the default locale by hovering over the default locale and clicking the edit button.

Once you add all the locales you need, it might look like this:

![Manage locales in settings](/images/localization-manage-locales.png)

</Step>

<Step title="Configure locales in your Next.js config">

The locales in your site settings need to match the locales configured in `next.config.mjs`. For example, to match the locales on the screenshot above, update `next.config.mjs` to be like this:

<NextConfigLocalizedExample />

Note that in `next.config.mjs`, you also need to put your `defaultLocale` in `locales`.
For example, here, we're adding `en-US` to the `locales`.

It is important to match the locales and the default locale on the site settings to the locales configured in `next.config.mjs`. Otherwise
the pages on the builder will not load properly.

</Step>

<Step title="Update snapshot fetching">
Once you set up locales in the site settings and in the Next.js config, you need to pass the locale from `getStaticProps` to `getPageSnapshot`.

<PagesCatchAllLocalizedExample />

This code is usually located in `[[...path]].tsx`, but it might be different depending on your setup.

</Step>

<Step title="Edit your pages in the builder">

Once you've set everything up, you should be able to switch to the locale using the locale switcher on the builder.

![Manage locales in settings](/images/localization-locales-switcher.png)

<Note>

You can customize the path for each page in each locale. For example, if you have a company page at `example.com/company`, you can create the Spanish version of the page at `example.com/es/compania` or `example.es/compania`.

</Note>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Domain-based localization

If you don't provide a domain for a locale, the localized pages will be located on the same domain as the default locale,
but nested on the locale's path. For example, `es` pages will be located on `example.com/es/page`.

To use domain-based localization, first, add the domain to the locale on your site settings:

![Adding domain-based on settings](/images/localization-domain-based-settings.png)

Then, add the domain to your `next.config.mjs`:

<NextConfigDomainLocalizedExample />

Once you've done that, the Spanish localized pages will be located on `example.es/page`.

## Localized resources

When making changes on a different locale you can override any property, including the page's pathname, metadata, and SEO tags.

You can also localize a global component. To do this, edit a global component within a localized page, make changes,
and then save the global component. That global component will be saved for that locale.
